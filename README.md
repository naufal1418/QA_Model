# PROJECT TITLE: QA Model

## AIM AND BACKGROUND


This QA (Question Answering) framework is developed using sequence model with attention mechanism. The dataset consists of questions, corresponding candidate answers, and labels indicating whether each sentence is the correct answer. Document preprocessing involves consolidating sentences into documents for each question and capturing the correct answer sentences.
